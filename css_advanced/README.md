This project is part of the ALX Front-End curriculum and demonstrates the application of advanced CSS techniques to build a responsive, multi-section landing page based on a Figma design. The implementation includes semantic HTML structure styled with modern CSS, using Flexbox and Grid for layout, media queries for responsiveness, and clean modular code that adheres to W3C standards. Key features include a styled header and banner, testimonial quote section, video tutorial cards, membership benefits layout, a responsive FAQ section, and a professional footer with social icons. No external frameworks were usedâ€”only raw HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome icons. The result is a visually accurate and fully functional webpage that reflects real-world front-end development practices.
