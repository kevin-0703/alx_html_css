this project is part of ALX Front-End curriculum and demonstrates the application of advanced css techniques to build responsive design, multi-section landing page based on figma design. this is a redo of the project as i previously did not put an effort into it but now i did and i learnt a lot and with more practice in coming weeks i expect to master what i done poorly in this project.
